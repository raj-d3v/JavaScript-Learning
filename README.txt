🧠 JavaScript Learning Repository
Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This is where I’m documenting my journey through JavaScript as I learn and practice concepts daily. The content is organized into chapters based on topics covered in BroCode's tutorials.

📚 Chapters Covered So Far
Each folder contains hands-on JavaScript files, notes, and examples for the topic.

Basics – Understanding how JavaScript integrates with HTML
Variables – var, let, const, and data types
Arithmetic Operators – +, -, *, /, %, and operator precedence

String Slicing – slice(), substring(), and substr()
Loops – for, while, and do...while loops
Arrays & Its Methods – Declaring arrays and using push, pop, shift, slice, etc.
Functions – Defining and calling functions
ForEach Loop – Looping through arrays using forEach()
📁 Project Structure
test.html – HTML file to test JavaScript scripts.
test.js – JavaScript file where all topics are tested and run.
